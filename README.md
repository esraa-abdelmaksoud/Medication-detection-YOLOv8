# Medication-detection-YOLOv8

Real-time medication packages detection without identifying them requires identifying the package existence in the streaming. Thus, a YOLO v8 model is trained in order to capture an image of the medication when it exists in the camera feed. This repository includes the files of the YOLO model.
